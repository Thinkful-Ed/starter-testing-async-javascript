# Starter: Testing Asynchronous JavaScript

This project provides a basic setup for writing and testing asynchronous JavaScript functions using Jest. It serves as a starter for learning and practicing how to handle asynchronous operations and testing them.

## Features

- Setup with Jest for testing.
- Example tests for asynchronous JavaScript functions.
- Instructions for running tests locally.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/starter-testing-async-javascript.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd starter-testing-async-javascript
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running Tests

To run the test suite, simply use:

```bash
npm test
```

This command will execute all tests found in the `tests` directory.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```bash
.
├── src             # Source code files
│   └── example.js  # Example asynchronous function to be tested
├── tests           # Test files
│   └── example.test.js  # Example test for the async function
├── .gitignore      # Files and directories to ignore in git
├── package.json    # Project dependencies and scripts
└── README.md       # Project documentation (this file)
```
